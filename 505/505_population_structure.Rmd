The goal of this script is to check the population structure of this 505 diversity panel. 

### 1) 
get the common SNPs between RNAseq and WGS for MDS analyiss, show the MDS plot 

SNP filtering for WGS data & RNAseq data 
QUAL > 40, lmiss < 0.5, mean read depth > 1 and < 100, MAF > 0.01 

* MAF 
SNPs due to sequencing errors will usually have major allele frequencies close to 1, because few genotypes will have an allele due to the error. So we could remove most SNPs due to sequencing errors by using this filter. If we do it, we will also filter out lots of real SNPs that are almost fixed in the population.

# stats for RNAseq data 
```{r} 
# QUAL score
QUAL <- read.delim("~/505/vcf_late_silique_131_sample/combined/505.lqual")
hist(log10(QUAL$QUAL))    
sum(QUAL$QUAL > 40)/nrow(QUAL) # 80% 
sum(QUAL$QUAL > 30)/nrow(QUAL) # 87% 

# MAF
MAF <- read.table("~/505/vcf_late_silique_131_sample/combined/MAF")
nrow(MAF)/nrow(QUAL) # 83% SNP out of all squence variations called from Freebayes

MAF <- 
MAF %>% 
  mutate(V7 = gsub("([[:print:]]+)(:)([[:print:]]+)", "\\3", V5), 
         V8 = gsub("([[:print:]]+)(:)([[:print:]]+)", "\\3", V6)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(V7, V8) 

MAF_minor <- as.numeric(apply(MAF, 1, min))  
sum(MAF_minor[!is.na(MAF_minor)] > 0.05) / nrow(QUAL) # 22% 
sum(MAF_minor[!is.na(MAF_minor)] > 0.01) / nrow(QUAL) # 54% # use this 
sum(MAF_minor[!is.na(MAF_minor)] > 0.001) / nrow(QUAL) # 80% # use this 

hist(as.numeric(apply(MAF, 1, min))) 

# mean read depth across individuals 
read_depth <- read.delim("~/505/vcf_late_silique_131_sample/combined/505.ldepth.mean")
mean(read_depth$MEAN_DEPTH) # 15  

hist(log10(read_depth$MEAN_DEPTH), breaks = 1000)
read_depth <- 
read_depth %>% 
  filter(MEAN_DEPTH > 1 & MEAN_DEPTH < 100) 

nrow(read_depth)/nrow(QUAL) # 97% 
hist(read_depth$MEAN_DEPTH, breaks = 500)

# missing rate 
# across taxa, on site level 
lmiss <- read.delim("~/505/vcf_late_silique_131_sample/combined/505.lmiss")
hist(lmiss$F_MISS) 
sum(lmiss$F_MISS < 0.5)/nrow(lmiss) # 79% left    
```

decide how to conduct population structure analysis, use all data or just one of these two datasets 

### 2) population structure analysis
